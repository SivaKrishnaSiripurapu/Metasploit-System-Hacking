# Metasploit-System-Hacking
This repository provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to system exploitation using the Metasploit Framework. The project emphasizes ethical hacking 

practices, offering insights into penetration testing methods for educational purposes. All techniques demonstrated here are intended for use in controlled, 

authorized environments only.

🔍 Key Features

🔹 Payload Creation for Windows Systems

📌 Purpose: Demonstrates how to craft custom payloads for Windows-based targets.

🛠️ Focus:

Reverse shells

Meterpreter payloads for further exploitation

🔹 Exploitation Techniques

📋 Purpose: Guides on how to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows systems using Metasploit.

🛠️ Techniques Covered:

Exploiting software vulnerabilities

Using Metasploit to automate and launch exploits

🔹 Privilege Escalation

📌 Purpose: Teaches how to escalate privileges within a compromised system.

🛠️ Focus:
